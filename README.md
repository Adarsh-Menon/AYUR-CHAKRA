PROBLEM STATEMENT:-Chatbot to Known Individual Prakriti (Phenotype)

AIM:
Our objective is to simplify self-awareness through the power of an AI-driven chatbot. We help users grasp the intricacies of their body and mind while nurturing their holistic well-being and happiness.

SOLUTION:
Harnessing advanced AI technology, our platform offers a comprehensive approach. It leverages a chatbot interface to provide personalized health tips, recommend dietary adjustments, suggest Ayurvedic principles, and offer yoga poses. By analyzing user responses, we ascertain dosha percentages, enabling a balanced life. This holistic AI-guided approach, rooted in Ayurveda, fosters physical and mental equilibrium, ultimately elevating overall health and vitality. Our commitment is to make wellness accessible and sustainable for all.

Personalized Wellness Assessment: Users can engage with the chatbot to answer questions about their physical and mental attributes. Based on their responses, the chatbot determines their predominant dosha and provides tailored health tips, diet recommendations, and yoga poses to balance it.

Daily Health Guidance: The chatbot can offer daily health reminders and tips specific to a user's dosha type. For instance, if a user is predominantly Pitta, it might suggest cooling foods and calming yoga poses to maintain balance.

Holistic Lifestyle Recommendations: Users can seek guidance on adopting an Ayurvedic lifestyle. The chatbot can provide insights on daily routines, mindfulness practices, and Ayurvedic remedies aligned with their dosha composition.

Mental Well-being Support: In line with the aim of promoting mental health, the chatbot can offer stress-relief techniques, meditation suggestions, and mindfulness exercises tailored to an individual's dosha for emotional equilibrium.

Long-term Health Tracking: Users can track their wellness journey over time with the chatbot's assistance. It can monitor progress, adapt recommendations as needed, and help users achieve and maintain a balanced life.

Ayurvedic Consultation: For more in-depth guidance, the chatbot can offer virtual Ayurvedic consultations, enabling users to discuss their health concerns and receive dosha-specific advice without the need for an in-person visit.

Educational Resource: Beyond personal assessments, the chatbot can serve as an educational resource, sharing articles, videos, and information on Ayurveda, doshas, and holistic well-being.
